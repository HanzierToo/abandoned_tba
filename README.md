# Abandoned _Text-Based Adventure_

### Description
Abandoned (aptly-named) is a text-based adventure game created during
my college years in the hours outside my study. It's nothing more than
a custom-content reskin of the template provided by the engine itself.
I would feel bad calling this game my own, so I won't, I practically only
did the base data and _"logic"_ but almost everything else was handled and
taken from the engine.

Currently there is a
**[public website](https://projects-ftsomoeai.freecluster.eu)**
release of the game hosted on
[infinityfree](https://www.infinityfree.net/).
However, the OpenSSL certificate is out of date and I can't
be asked to update it (the process takes way too long for me to
bother). Note that the version on the website is often times several
releases behind the main branch as the loading times and access to
the websites' files are unbearably slow and unintuitive (basically, I'm lazy).

### Version History
* Preview Build 1 | 31/07/22
  * 1 Room Available (Intro Cell)
* Preview Build 2 | --/08/22 _~~I forgor~~_
  * 2 Rooms Available (Intro Cell + Chamber)
* **Preview Build 3 [Active Build]** | --/10/22 _~~I forgor again~~_
  * 4 Rooms Available (Intro Cell + Chamber, Armoury, Ground Floor)

### Update (15/11/22)
As I'm currently being swamped by the endless abyss known as _**uni work**_ I've
postponed work on the project for the foreseeable future. The intro section
is more or less done in terms of the narrative (similar to a chapter of a book)
so the experience shouldn't be _too_ abruptly interrupted.
